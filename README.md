## This repository
> In this course we focused on learn more specific concepts about JavaScript and how do they work into a real project.

## Introduction

#### What is JavaScript?
> JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.

## Main Content
> - `Call, Apply, Bind`: call and apply call a function while bind creates a function. Though with call() you pass arguments individually and apply() as an argument array. 
> - `Prototype`: is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript,
> - `Abstract Syntax Tree`:  is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language.
> - `Event Loop`:The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
> - `Service Workers`: A service worker is a script that runs independently in the browser background. On the user side, it can intercept its network requests and decide what to load (fetch).
> - `Proxy`:A proxy server is any machine that translates traffic between networks or protocols. It’s an intermediary server separating end-user clients from the destinations that they browse.
> - `IntersectionObserver`:An Intersection Observer is a browser API that provides a way to observe the visibility and position of a DOM element relative to the containing root element or viewport.
> - `VisibilityChange`:The visibilitychange event is fired at the document when the contents of its tab have become visible or have been hidden.
> - `Design patterns`: Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
